        "Machine learning algorithms cannot understand categorical strings such as student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male) unless we convert them to numerical values (0 : 'F' and 1 : 'M'). We can do this using Label Encoding. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Label Encoding** assigns a value from 1 through N for each categories for the feature, here we are assuming there are N categories. For eg:  Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) has already been encoded numerically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoder assumes that there is some order in the data, i.e value 2 is greater than value 1, which is good if the data is oridnal but it is not suitable for nominal data types without any inherent order, such as mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other'), in such cases we need to perform some other encoding method, such as one-hot Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-hot Encoding** maps each category to a vector that contains 1 and 0 denoting the presence or absence of the feature. Hence, this method will create multiple columns based on the cardinality of the features, i.e number of categories in the feature. For: eg: Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') has 4 different categories, hence 4 columns will be created.\n",
